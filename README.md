👋 Hi, I’m @ClemiraJenkins — but you can call me Clemira!

🌱 I’m currently a Computer Science student at Singapore Management University (SMU), passionate about building cool, meaningful projects that blend creativity with tech.

👀 I’m interested in:
- Full-stack web and mobile app development  
- Game development and interactive storytelling  
- AI and machine learning (especially creative AI!)  
- UI/UX design and human-centered computing  
- Music-tech, generative art, and digital experiences  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Hackathon projects (hit me up!)  
- Open-source tools that empower students and creators  
- Games or apps that make everyday life easier or more fun
